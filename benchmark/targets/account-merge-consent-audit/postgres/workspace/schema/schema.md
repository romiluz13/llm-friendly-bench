# Schema Contract: Account merge with consent audit

Lane: postgres

Business prompt:
Implement a governed account merge workflow. Combine duplicate account records, contacts, consent preferences, open cases, active orders, invoices, activities, and audit requirements without losing customer-visible history.

Expected outcome:
Merge review ready with consent-safe contact plan, linked records, and audit export.
